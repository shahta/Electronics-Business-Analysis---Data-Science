# Automated Electronics Business Analysis

This project provided my a solid foundation and introduction into Data Science. It is an analysis of the sales of an electronics store over the course of the year.
The purpose of the project is to answer questions in order to boost revenue and profits for the upcoming year. I achieved this through the Pandas and NumPy Python libraries.
I started by cleaning the data. Next, I performed feature engineering on the dataset so that I could answer the given questions easier. Then I performed groupby and aggregating functions on the dataset to extract crucial information. For some of the questions that I answered, I also included a visual representation using Matplotlib. This helped to identify trends and improve the "business model".
